# NeuralNetwork-ProductClassification
Tensorflow and Keras watch classification neural network trained using Kaggle Dataset

Runs on Jupyter Notebooks - suggested to train classifier for 20 epochs as otherwise is too inacurate.

Upload own files to the directory and make sure to specify them in the file path when using as otherwise they will get lost and it won't work.

Dataset download is also required for training and references are included in the top of the code.

Enjoy.
